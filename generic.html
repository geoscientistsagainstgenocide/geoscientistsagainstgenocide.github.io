							<h2>Lockheed Martin out of AGU!</h2>
							<p>The Petition from Geoscientists Against Genocide</p>
						</header>
						<section class="wrapper style5">
							<div class="inner">

								<h3>The Petition</h3>

								<p>We, the undersigned members of the Earth and space science community, call on the American Geophysical Union to cancel its association with the Lockheed Martin Corporation. By accepting major sponsorship for this year’s AGU fall meeting from a company profiting from war and playing a central role in arming the ongoing genocide in Gaza, the AGU undermines its own positions in support of environmental protection, climate action, education, and inclusivity.
								</p>

								<p>Israel is in its fifteenth month of an escalated genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, in continuation of a much longer campaign of violent displacement and ethnic cleansing. The current genocide has taken well over 44,000 lives, including those of over 17,000 children. Israel has deliberately destroyed agricultural land and equipment, destroyed water infrastructure, used internationally banned white phosphorous against civilians, and bombed Gaza’s built environment into tens of millions of metric tons of rubble. By obstructing the delivery of humanitarian aid and attacking Gaza’s healthcare and sanitation systems, Israel has manufactured conditions of rampant famine and disease. 90% of Gaza’s population has been forcibly displaced, often many times over. Israel has devastated the conditions of dignified life in Gaza while escalating violence against civilians in the West Bank and Lebanon. These actions, which are in violation of international law, are made possible by weapons and advanced technology from the United States. 
								</p>

								<p>Lockheed Martin provides weapons and technology that Israel uses to commit genocide against Palestinians, including F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, Hellfire missiles, C-130 Hercules transport planes, and CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopters. Since October 2023, the company has been awarded tens of millions of dollars in additional military contracts, and CEO James Taiclet has highlighted Israel’s military campaign as a driver of future profits. 
								</p>

								<p>While the AGU is granting Lockheed Martin social license and a platform at its fall meeting, Israel is producing environmental catastrophe and perpetrating scholasticide with Lockheed Martin’s support. Waste management systems and water infrastructure in Gaza have collapsed, forcing people to drink brackish, contaminated water and to live in close proximity to untreated sewage. Israel’s extensive assaults have polluted air with toxic contaminants such as asbestos, and inflicted long term damage on regional ecosystems and soil. People in Gaza are left extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Additionally, greenhouse gas emissions from Israel’s attacks on Gaza during the first 120 days of 2024, excluding construction of military infrastructure and future rebuilding, exceed the annual emissions of 26 individual countries and territories combined. Israel has systematically targeted Gaza’s education system, destroying over 80% of schools and every university. Numerous libraries, archives, and museums have been damaged, looted, or destroyed. Israel has killed at least 10,490 school and university students and over 500 educators. 625,000 school-age children are missing education for the second year. It is not a coincidence, moreover, that no Palestinian institutions are represented at the AGU fall meeting. 
								</p>

								<p>As researchers and educators who hope to see our work used for good, we are aware of how scientific knowledge and technology can also be used for cultural and environmental destruction. We take seriously the AGU’s charge to “protect the health and safety of people, animals, and the environment”. We therefore urge the AGU to reject associations with Lockheed Martin and any corporations whose profit-seeking goals violate a core part of AGU’s mission and its members’ work toward a more sustainable future.
